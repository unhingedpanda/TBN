# Development Decisions and Rationale

## Architecture and Technology Stack

### Framework Selection: FastAPI
**Decision**: Used FastAPI over Flask or Django
**Rationale**:
- Async support for better performance with I/O operations (IMAP, Slack API)
- Automatic OpenAPI documentation generation
- Type safety with Pydantic models
- Modern Python patterns and excellent developer experience
- Smaller bundle size compared to full Django

### Database: SQLAlchemy with PostgreSQL/SQLite
**Decision**: SQLAlchemy ORM with dual database support
**Rationale**:
- PostgreSQL for production (ACID compliance, performance)
- SQLite for development (zero configuration, file-based)
- SQLAlchemy for database abstraction and migration support
- Proper relationship modeling between cases and messages

### Email Processing: Built-in imaplib
**Decision**: Used Python's built-in `imaplib` over third-party libraries
**Rationale**:
- No external dependencies for email processing
- Full control over IMAP connection and parsing
- Better security (no external API keys needed)
- Simpler deployment and maintenance

### Slack Integration: python-slack-sdk
**Decision**: Used official Slack SDK over requests library
**Rationale**:
- Official library with proper error handling
- Built-in retry logic and rate limiting
- Type hints and comprehensive documentation
- Webhook verification support

## Implementation Approach

### Component-Based Architecture
**Decision**: Modular component design with clear separation of concerns
**Rationale**:
- Each component (email, slack, scheduler, notifications) can be tested independently
- Easier debugging and maintenance
- Clear interfaces between components
- Better scalability for future enhancements

### Configuration-Driven Design
**Decision**: Environment variables for all configuration
**Rationale**:
- Security (no hardcoded credentials)
- Environment-specific settings (dev/prod)
- Easy deployment across different environments
- Clear documentation of required settings

### Background Processing with APScheduler
**Decision**: APScheduler for escalation checks over cron jobs
**Rationale**:
- Python-native solution (no external processes)
- Configurable intervals and job management
- Proper error handling and logging
- Easy testing and mocking

## Business Logic Implementation

### Case Creation Strategy
**Decision**: Customer identifier-based case lookup
**Rationale**:
- Simple and reliable identification mechanism
- Works across both email and Slack channels
- Easy to understand and debug
- Supports multiple communication channels per customer

### Escalation Rule Implementation
**Decision**: Three separate escalation triggers evaluated independently
**Rationale**:
- Each rule has different logic and timing requirements
- Easier to test and debug individual rules
- More flexible for future rule modifications
- Clear separation of concerns

### Message Processing Pipeline
**Decision**: Synchronous processing with comprehensive error handling
**Rationale**:
- Simpler debugging and troubleshooting
- Immediate feedback on processing results
- Better error visibility in logs
- Easier to implement retry logic if needed

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests for Business Logic
**Decision**: Comprehensive unit tests for core functions
**Rationale**:
- Fast execution and reliable testing
- Easy to run in CI/CD pipelines
- Clear test coverage for critical paths
- Documentation of expected behavior

### Integration Tests with Sample Data
**Decision**: Demo scripts and sample data for end-to-end testing
**Rationale**:
- Validates complete workflows
- Easy for evaluators to run and verify
- Demonstrates real-world usage scenarios
- Catches integration issues early

## Deployment and DevOps

### Docker Multi-Stage Builds
**Decision**: Multi-stage Dockerfile for optimal image size
**Rationale**:
- Smaller production images
- Faster deployments
- Better security (no build tools in runtime)
- Optimized layer caching

### Docker Compose for Full Stack
**Decision**: Complete docker-compose setup with PostgreSQL
**Rationale**:
- One-command deployment
- Proper service dependencies
- Volume management for data persistence
- Easy scaling and configuration

### Development vs Production Parity
**Decision**: Separate configurations for dev/prod environments
**Rationale**:
- SQLite for development (simplicity)
- PostgreSQL for production (reliability)
- Debug endpoints only in development
- Proper logging levels for each environment

## Security Considerations

### Credential Management
**Decision**: Environment variables for all secrets
**Rationale**:
- No hardcoded credentials in source code
- Easy rotation and management
- Different credentials per environment
- Integration with secret management systems

### Input Sanitization
**Decision**: Message body sanitization and length limits
**Rationale**:
- Prevent potential security issues
- Database performance optimization
- Consistent data handling
- Protection against malformed input

## Performance Optimizations

### Database Indexing
**Decision**: Strategic indexing on frequently queried columns
**Rationale**:
- Fast case lookups by customer identifier
- Efficient status-based queries
- Optimized message retrieval
- Better query performance for escalation checks

### Connection Pooling
**Decision**: SQLAlchemy connection pooling configuration
**Rationale**:
- Efficient database connection reuse
- Better performance under load
- Proper connection lifecycle management
- Reduced database server load

### Message Size Limits
**Decision**: 10KB limit on message content
**Rationale**:
- Prevents database bloat
- Maintains performance
- Reasonable limit for support messages
- Clear truncation with indicators

## Future Enhancement Considerations

### Scalability Planning
**Decision**: Modular design for easy scaling
**Rationale**:
- Component isolation allows independent scaling
- Database can be moved to managed services
- Message queuing can be added for high volume
- Stateless design supports horizontal scaling

### Monitoring and Observability
**Decision**: Structured logging throughout application
**Rationale**:
- Easy integration with log aggregation systems
- Better debugging and troubleshooting
- Performance monitoring capabilities
- Business metric tracking

### API Design
**Decision**: RESTful API with clear endpoints
**Rationale**:
- Standard HTTP methods and status codes
- Easy integration with external systems
- Clear API documentation
- Future extensibility for web interface

This document captures the key technical decisions made during development, providing context for the implementation choices and rationale for future maintainers and evaluators.
